ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm Kareem. I'm a recent Computer Science graduate from Carleton University. I currently work @ [Neurovine](www.neurovine.ai) - we're trying to leverage software and ai to aid concussion patients with their recovery process. My main intersts are in software engineering, statistics, machine learning and a bit of music composition. I currently live in Ottawa - Canada's Capital.
